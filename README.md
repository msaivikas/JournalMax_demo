# JournalMax demo app
i made my first flutter app.
this repo is to see if there are any changes i need to make before i can publish it on google playstore.
> i want to see if the authentication & user-data is safe enough
> i want to see if there are any better ways to implement stuff that i implemented

# app usage

> users can write their journal in this app everyday
> all the data is stored locally on device using sqflite
> authentication is being handled using firebase
> there's a button when clicked, will take that day's journal entry and display a list of 3 actionable items

- iOS specific features are yet to be implemented but android features are working fine afaik
